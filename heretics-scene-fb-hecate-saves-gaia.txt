/* NEW SCENE: KINGSLEY returns from BOREAS */

Kingsley has turned into a Cetonic Demon to sneak her and Stewart through monster infested waters. When she reaches the safe teritory, she is caught by Water Spirits. Since she is still not in control of her transformation powers, she transforms into one of them before their eyes. From this, they mistake her for Caster. They capture her and bring her before their LEADER [Name?] bound in the same cage they had Caster in before allowing him passage.

LEADER, believing her to be Caster, condemns and berates her for returning to their realmn against his promise. Kingsley pleads with LEADER that she is not Caster. Stewart tries to help by stating that Kingsley is a woman, but LEADER interupts, "The Trickster is whatever he wishes to be." LEADER moves in closer to Kingsley in her cage, "that's why we've found other ways to it's you." Kingsley reminds her that Caster had two mortals with him and so someone must be missing. LEADER agrees but insits that it must be one of the humans still before her is caged a God. Kingsley frantically explains how they switched powers. LEADER laughs at this and claims that the Devil would never do this. Out of curiosity, LEADER asks suspeciaously, "what happened to the Devil then?". Kingsley wells up with tears again and mutters that he is gone, dead. LEADER laughs even harder. "Show me", she says, "I want to see the body." We burried him at sea at the edge of Boreas. LEADER points out how convient it is to claim his body dwells in the dark depths of demon controlled waters where no one could verify this.

Kingsley sighs and pleads. She gets an idea and insits that LEADER summon Hecate, she will know the difference. LEADER explains with reverance that one does not simply /summon/ the last of the Titans. Kingsley tells LEADER to mention that she has the Devil's Champion, that Hecate will know what that means and will comeforthwith. 

LEADER is bored with this conversation now. "Tomorrow we will make your lies truth by taking you to the depths at the edge of Boreas and tossing you into the dark, demonic waters. One of LEADER's advisors asks, "what should we do with the mortal?". "Kill him, it will be a mercy". "No!" cries Kingsley as the guards start to behead Stewart. Kingsley loses her shit and rattles her cage. She screams, "No, stop", over and over.

LEADER asks, "what is this mortal to /you/, trickster?". "He's... he's my... my ah... boyfriend, I guess. Just don't hurt him, please. Kill me, but just let him go," she begs. LEADER carefully looks her over, suspeciously. "What does it mean, this 'Champion'?" "Ugh, the Trickster is my father. He is helping Hecate to stop Lucifer, not to be good or anything, just to keep Lucifer from gaining absolute control over the universe. That's why he gave me his powers, so that I could fight Lucifer." "Fight Lucifer?!?"

LEADERS sits quietly on her throne and conteplaters Kingsley's story. "I still do not beleive you, but that is a story worth verifying. You will stay in the cage until I get my answer. Do not hope that Hecate will come quickly."

For days Kingsley lives in that cage. Stewart is in a separate cage beside hers. When Hecate finally arrives, she proclaims, "You've captured the Trickster! Is he an offering to me?" "So, it /is/ the Trickster after all. I knew he lied." "Who did he claim to be?" "The champion. She said you would know what that means." "I do." Hecate crouches down to see Kingsley between the bars. "If you are the champion why do you possess the Trickster's powers?" "I, ah.. he switched so that I could turn into an Angel and be bound to [Borea's Archangel]'s Pyrkovis." Hecate is surprised by the plausibility of this answer. Kingsley pulls the Pyrkovis hilt out of her clothes. Hecate stands in shock at this. "Show me," she commands. "But I can't, I can't control this power. I... I don't know how. I'm only in Water Spirit form because I am surrounded by them. It just happens," kingsley pleads. Disappointed, Hecate sigh, "I thought as much. It's a trick". "No, no," Kingsley pleads. She stares at her Pyrkovis and hits herself in the head, muttering, "Come on, come on!" Kingsley gets angrier at herself and her failure, "Do it Nikki, do it". Hecate turns to return home, "You waste my time Trickster". Then suddenly Kinglsey erupts from her cage as she becomes an Archangel. She stands, the Pyrkovis reveals its flaming blade. "I did it!" Kingsley says happily. But then she turns sour and looks to LEADER in rage. Kingsley leaps with an Angel's grace to LEADER and punches her square in the face. She strikes her again and then points at her, "That's for putting me in a cage, bitch". Triumphantly Kingsley strides down the throne steps. Hecate leans over to LEADER, "She's not the Trickster."

When Hacate has Kingsley off to one side, she says, "Can you not read my mind?" "I ah, no. When I try I just geta splitting headache." "Oh, we must work on this. You will need that power to face Lucifer. Come." Hecate shows Kingsley the cage's lock. With a small tug to falls into dust and fragments. "Seriously," Kingsley mutters. "It is one of the advantages to being the Trickster." "I have the power to rust locks?" "it is not your power. The universe will not let you be trapped or controlled. The universe cannot let Chaos be contained or controlled, it would be a paradox, you see?". "but you do not controll it. It takes as long as it takes and you will never know what escape the universe has made for you. So you can be trapped temporilay, just not permanately.

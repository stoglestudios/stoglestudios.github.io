            <!-- Just add the video id into the data-ektron-youtube/vimeo attr. -->
            <!-- Umptron has its own presets for these players but you can override them with the data-ektron-options, same format as the APIs for these players -->
            <button data-ektron-youtube="e2dwwMHg7ZQ" data-ektron-options="modestbranding=1&rel=<%= 1 %>" data-ektron-css="display:inline-block; height:50px; width:200px; background-color:darkgreen; &:hover{background-color:darkred;box-shadow: 0 0 10px black;}">Watch Made to Grow</button>
            <!-- Vimeo, for example, let's you customize a theme color. Umptron allows for easy setup for this color to be managed by Ektron -->
            <button data-ektron-vimeo="<%= 144404612 %>" data-ektron-options="color=<%= 72ccd2%>" data-ektron-css="display:inline-block; height:50px; width:200px; background-color:darkgreen; &:hover{background-color:darkred;box-shadow: 0 0 10px black;}">Watch a Puppy Video</button>
            <p>Umptron provides a quick and easy way to add video, both YouTube and Vimeo, to a page that will be easy for Ektron to provide the video id and even paramenters such as the color theme for vimeo.</p>

        <section id="puppies">
            <p>One advantage to a CMS, like Ektron, is that the widgets can be reused. However, I found this problematic with id attributes because they must be unique on each page and should be unique across pages of a microsite for CSS/JS targeting. Therefore, we should try to avoid using id attributes wherever possible and use classes instead. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="puppies">
            <p>Umptron can help with this issue by automatically updating all <b>body>section</b> tags with unique classes based on the page they appear on. One will be the page name from the URL (minus the extension, if applicable). In this case, "index.html" becomes "index". The other class will be the page name plus the section's ID. These unique classes will help targeting elements from different instantiations of the same widget with css and js. If the same widget appears on the same page, its id will get changed to a sequence. "my_id", becomes "my_id0", "my_id1", "my_id2", etc. This means that every widget should really be inclosed with a section tag--which makes semantic sense anyway.</p>

            <h2>Part 3: JRR Tolkien and Building Ektron-like Loops in HTML Using Temp Data</h2>
            <p>The list below is made from a JSON file. This way the HTML will look very similar to what the Ektron view code will look like which can help with communication between devs as well as help see potential problems before handing off ot the back end. This should make things easier for the integration, but also front end development because A) you don't have to hand code every item in the list. (sure you could use Angular, but that will just be removed and redone upon integration and Angualr isn't built specificly for this kind of CMS development. And B) it helps the front end dev think about things in the right way in order to avoid tangled issues later.</p>

                <!-- Loop for easy integration with Ektron -->

                <!-- Assigning an id will automatically get numbers added (ie my-list becomes my-list0, my-list1, my-list2, etc), but this is
                        for front end developement and will still need to be added in ektron with <%=j %> -->

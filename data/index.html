            <p>One advantage to a CMS, like Ektron, is that the widgets can be reused. However, this can also be problematic with id attributes because they must be unique on each page. Therefore, we should try to avoid using id attributes wherever possible and use classes instead. Additionally, the CSS can be hard to work with since the same widget will have exactly the same class and id names as other instantiations of that same widget elsewhere. This will makes things difficult if you want to style those instances differently but with the same stylesheets. Or target them in JS/jQuery, for that matter.   </p>
        </section>
        <section id="puppies">
            <p>To deal with this, Umptron will update all <b>body>section</b> tags with unique classes based on the page they appear on. One will be the page name from the URL (minus the extension, if applicable). In this case, "index.html" becomes "index". The other class will be the page name plus the section's ID. These unique classes will help targeting elements from different instantiations of the same widget with css and js. If the same widget appears on the same page, its id will get changed to a sequence. "my_id", becomes "my_id0", "my_id1", "my_id2", etc. This means that every widget should really be inclosed with a section tag--which makes semantic sense anyway.</p>

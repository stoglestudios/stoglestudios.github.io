                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>
    Heretics is an Epic in the classic sense of the word. Too often the word is used to simply mean big, explosive, and complicated when really it refers to an intimate story. For example, the Civil War is an extraordinary event that is important to the <i>plot</i> of Gone With the Wind, however that movie is not about the Civil War. It’s about a complex relationship that changes and evolves over time as they are forced to deal with the Civil War. Although, the events that make up the rising political tensions between North and South, followed by the battles, and the ultimate resolution of he war are interesting and certainly add to the story, Red and Scarlet’s battles are the ones that matter. The war really only exists to overburden their relationship beyond what it can bare. That’s the drama and tension of an Epic.
<br><br>                    
    Heretics is about two relationships. In one, Special Agent Kinglsey must find a way to deal with her untrustworthy father — and not just the external creature that is her father, but the version of her father that exists as a part of her. She must let go of the anger that lives deep inside her from the isolation and betrayal of her childhood and reshape herself into a hero despite the villain her father raised her to be. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
    Although she has managed to escape her father and made a somewhat normal life for herself as an FBI Agent, her investigations into a series of gruesome murders stands to untangle that life. The clues quickly take her to the conclusion that the murders have been committed by the Archangel Lucifer as some plot to bring about Armageddon. And reconnecting with her troublesome father, a trickster god known to many as The Devil, will be a treacherous necessity if she is to stop the The Beast’s catastrophic plot.
<br><br>
    The other story follows a young couple, Dan and Claire. Their’s is the kind of marriage so perfect and cutesie, you wonder if anything could ever rip them apart. More than that, they are nice and good people. But one seemingly normal day, they ruthlessly discover that Dan is the earthly progeny of the Archangel Lucifer. Lucifer’s power, as well as his scattered and jumbled memories, flood into Dan so ferociously that his body is burned to dust and reformed into something no longer human. Their ideal relationship will be tested beyond what it can bare, especially after The Devil arrives to “help” them.

                    <p class="filler">
                        Nikki Kingsley grew up to be an FBI agent to rebel against her father, CASTER. Obvious, but true. But she would say that when she uses her powers to help people it proves that CASTER could have too. It proves that she is better than him. But there is a deeper reason, a subconscious one. She associates the crime and cruelty of the world with her father’s “job”. When she brings in a bad guy or saves someone and makes the world a better place She’s creating a world where her father would never need to go off to “work”. She gets the warm feeling that she’s in her daddy’s arms and he’ll never have to leave. Now that the world is good, he can stay with her everyday. He could be a dentist or something. Something normal.
Her abandonment issues cause her to keep people at an emotional distance and give deep, often explosive anger.

                        Born and raised in Seattle, WA, Dan had a particularly uneventful, middle-class childhood which lead to a mostly boring adult life as a programmer. The only thing that stands out about him is his unusually perfect marriage with Claire. Until, that is, the day he realizes that he is the earthly descendent of the Archangel Lucifer when he is suddenly flooded with new memories and powers. His psyche becomes a fragmented scramble of Lucifer and himself. Dan maintains primary control, but increasing he doubts this as he gives into to his darker instincts and rationalizations.

                        Last of the Immortal Titans, Hecate defends our world from the dangerous forces of Gods, Angels and Demons that lie beyond our world. She accepted this mission from her mentor, the Titan Gaia, to protect the Tree of Life. Hecate is lord of the realm, Khthon, where life and death meet. It is the world between ours and the Underworld. It is a world of witchcraft and necromancy. She carries the first Pyrkovis, sword of flame, that was created by the Titans to destroy Kaos and Kosmos but was later copied to give Angels a weapon to kill Immortals.

                        He became a friend of the Chicago Police Dept. ever since he helped them solve a series of murders where the killer had left clues in ancient Greek. Subsequently, he has been asked to translate on several cases. He is fluent in 7 modern languages, proficient in 11 others, and literate in many ancient languages including Latin, Greek, Egyptian and Sumerian. He earned a B.A. in anthropology from Illinois state and a Masters in Linguistics from Northwestern. He's the very portrait of the stumbling, nerdy professor. But age has brought good looks which has made him a magnet for women with daddy issues. He is now twice divorced.

                    <p>
                        When the universe first formed, there were thousands of realms and, with each, premordial Titans. Those Early Titans fought and unified neiboring realms by the more powerful Titans. For example, several realms of death, emptiness, and nonexistence were unified into the many realms of Hell under the rule of the Titan Hades. The lessor Titans like the ferryman, Charon, or the reaper, Thanatos, became servents onto Hades. Once this period settled, the universe fell into a long period of peace and wisdom... until the arrival of the <a href="#gods" class="gods">Gods</a>.

            <p class="container">
                Here’s me in a nutshell, I’m a maker. I deeply enjoy making things. I also get excited by learning knew things, but learning and making are intertwined, perhaps the same even. It’s summed up perfectly in a quote from Richard Feynman, “What I cannot create, I do not understand”. That's what I love about web development. It's constantly charging ahead, and you have to run to keep up.

                2. My Art History
            </h1>
            <p class="container">
                My first critique was a crayon drawing of our family. I had drawn my mother’s hair purple crayon because I lost the brown crayon. My father was an Art teacher. He used this as a chance to teach me that you can make brown using other colors—and it is generally more dynamic that way. Also, Art isn’t just about literal truth. It’s Okay for my mother to have purple hair if that carries some meaning. Kinda heavy stuff for a four year old, but that was my upbringing. Make, review, make better.

                3. Laziness can be Hard Work 
            </h1>
            <p class="container">
                The first time I was promoted management, was at Pizza Hut when I was eighteen. I think it was because I was lazy (you read that right). I hated having to remake pizzas after an accident or lose time restocking. I see everything as a problem to be solved. So I did. I reorganized the kitchen to reduce collisions, rearranged prep to reduce restock time, and redesigned systems to avoid miscommunications. We dropped the time to make a pizza, by about fifteen seconds. When you make hundreds of pizzas and hour, that little change makes a huge difference.

                4. My Roots with STEM 
            </h1>
            <p class="container">
                What I learned from teaching is that humans will rise to or fall to the expectations set for them. Visits to my office hours constantly started with the phrase, “Hi, I’m Not-a-Math-Person”. As if that were their names. It always turned that they believed that to be true because they were told it was true, directly or indirectly, by an authority. It turned that my job wasn’t to teach science, it was to believe in their ability to do Math until they believed it. When they did, sure enough, they stopped coming to my office ours. They could help themselves.

                5. Leadership or Lead Ship 
            </h1>
            <p class="container">
                I dislike liked the term “self starter”. How can anyone else start you? Sure, I’ve met people who weren’t self starters, but in my experience, it took only the tiniest push to make them one. When we work for bad managers who push blame down the hierarchy while steeling credit from below, we learn initiative doesn’t pay. A leader knows that success always comes from the bottom, while failure always comes from the top. Leadership is about making other people successful by nurturing trust, ownership, and problem solving.

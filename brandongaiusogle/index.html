                My name is Brandon and this is a page about me—a topic I dread discussing for two reasons. First, I already know everything there is to know about me. I get excited by learning knew things, so writing about me is, well, kinda boring. I have to remind myself that you are not me and you might be interested. Second, I generally distrust people who’s favorite topic is themselves. As a rule, they're too sociopathic for my taste. Consequently, I feel creepy talking about myself too much. To that end, here’s me in a nutshell: I’m a maker. I like to make stuff, which relates intimately with how I said learning is what excites me. It’s summed up perfectly in a quote from Richard Feynman, “What I cannot create, I do not understand”.

                My first critique was a crayon drawing of our family when I was four. I drew my mother’s hair with a purple crayon because I lost the brown. My father was an Art teacher. He used this as a chance to teach me that you can make brown with other colors and it is generally more dynamic that way. He also taught me that art isn’t just about literal truth. It could also be metaphorical truth. It was Okay for my mother to have purple hair if it had meaning. I was lucky to learn to use a potter’s wheel or paint on canvas from an early age. It was fun and now the creative process is in my very blood and bones.

                I’ve been in managerial roles since before I understood anything about leadership. The first time I was promoted, was at Pizza Hut when I was eighteen. I think it was because I was lazy. Yep, you read that right. I hated having to run back to the cooler when we ran out of stuff. I hated having to remake a pizza when there was a miscommunication or an accident. As a Math and Science nerd, I tended to see everything as a problem to be solved. So I did. Within the first few months working there, I reorganized the kitchen so we didn't have to run into each other as much, rearranged how we did prep so we didn't have to restock as much, and redesigned many of our systems to avoid miscommunications. I’ve come to realize that efficiency is something I’m passionate about.

                On Leadership
            </h1>
            <p class="">
                I dislike liked the term “self starter”. Who else would start you, but yourself? So... isn’t everyone a self starter? Sure, I’ve met people who weren’t, but in my experience, it took only the tiniest push to make them one, like it was in them all along. When we work for bad managers who push blame down the hierarchy while steeling credit from below, we learn it doesn’t pay to take initiative. A leader knows that success always comes from the bottom, while failure always comes from the top. It's not about taking credit, it's about giving it. And the reverse for blame. It’s difficult for many managers to accept this, but leadership is not about being right, it’s about giving ownership, fostering trust amongst a team, focusing on solutions, and making others successful.

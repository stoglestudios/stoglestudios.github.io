                    Here’s me in a nutshell: I’m a maker. I deeply enjoy making things. Learning new things also excites me, but learning and making are intertwined, perhaps the same. It’s summed up perfectly in a quote from Richard Feynman, “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” That's what I love about web development. It's constantly charging ahead, and you have to run to keep pace.

                    2. A Good Sign to Go Design
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I see design as where art and engineering intersect. Art is simply about noticing details. When an author listens astutely to how people speak, their dialog sounds more believable and feels more intimate. Engineers solve problems making mechanical systems interact with each other. Designers solve problems with machines interacting with human beings. What better way to do this than to be carefully perceptive of how we humans experience the world? When is a pen too heavy or a website too confusing? If you notice these things and see them as problems to be solved, you are a designer.

                <p>
                    My first critique was for a crayon drawing of our family. I had drawn my mother’s hair in purple crayon because I’d lost the brown one. My father was an art teacher, and used this as a chance to teach me that you can make brown using other colors—and that it’s generally more dynamic. Also, that art isn’t just about literal truth. It’s okay for my mom to have purple hair if that carries meaning. Heavy stuff for a four year old, but that was my upbringing. Make, review, make better.

                <p>
                    The first time I was promoted to management, I was 18 and working at Pizza Hut. I think it was because I was lazy (you read that right). I hated having to remake pizzas after an accident, or to lose time restocking. I see everything as a problem to be solved. So I solved. I reorganized the kitchen to reduce collisions, rearranged prep to reduce restock time, and redesigned systems to avoid miscommunications. We dropped the time to make each pizza by about fifteen seconds. When you make hundreds of pizzas an hour, that little change made a huge difference.

                <p> 
                    What I learned from teaching is that most humans will rise to or fall to the expectations set for them. Visits to my office hours constantly started with the phrase, “Hi, I’m-not-a-math-person…” as if that were their name. It always turned out that they believed that to be true because at some point they were told it was true (directly or indirectly) by an authority. In many cases, my job wasn’t to teach science; it was to believe in their ability to do math until they believed it. When they did, sure enough, they stopped coming to my office hours. They had the confidence to help themselves.

                <p>
                    I dislike the term “self-starter.” How can anyone else start you? Sure, I’ve met people who weren’t self-starters, but in my experience, it took only the smallest push to make them one. When we work for bad managers who push blame down the hierarchy while stealing credit from below, we learn that initiative doesn’t pay. A leader knows that success often comes from the bottom, and failure from the top. Leadership is about making other people successful by nurturing trust, ownership, and problem solving.
